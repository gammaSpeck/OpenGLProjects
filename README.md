# OpenGLProjects
This repo contains the Prim's algorithm implementation using OpenGL
(This does NOT illustrate the working of the Prim's Algorithm but simply only shows the input Weighted Graph
and the final Minimum Spanning tree)
This also contains all of the VTU SPECIFIED CG Lab Programs for 2018
