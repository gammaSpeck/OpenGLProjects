To execute bford.cpp make sure you have installed OpenGL (freeglut or whatever) and also the necessary Compiler.
I have not discussed what pre requites are needed for running OpenGL codes.
Honestly, if you dont even have that done, then dont bother downloading this one.


Then open the directory where the code bford.cpp is stored and execute the following commands:
$ gcc bford.cpp -lGLU -lGL -lglut -lm -Wno-write-strings
$ ./a.out 



Follow the procedure as shown in the screenshots


In this, there is also a report fro the entire project.
Enjoy ;)
